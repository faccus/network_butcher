# aMLLibrary
Library for the generation of regression models.

The main script of the library is `run.py`:

```
usage: run.py [-h] -c CONFIGURATION_FILE [-d] [-o OUTPUT] [-j J] [-g] [-l] [-k]

Perform exploration of regression techniques

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIGURATION_FILE, --configuration-file CONFIGURATION_FILE
                        configuration file for the infrastructure
  -d, --debug           enable debug messages
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output folder where all the models will be stored
  -j J                  number of processes to be used
  -g, --generate-plots  generate plots
  -l, --details         print results of the single experiments
  -k, --keep-temp       do not remove temporary files after successful execution

```
Example of configuration files can be found under `example_configurations` directory.
See also the [`README.md`](example_configurations/README.md) file there.


## Installation
You can use `git clone` in the terminal to download the library.
Since it includes the HyperOpt submodule, you must also add the appropriate flag:
```shell
git clone <SSH/HTTPS url of the library> --recurse-submodules
```
Or, if you forgot the flag, you can still download the submodules even after cloning by running:
```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```


## Tutorial
To run your first example job with this library, please issue the following command in your terminal:
```shell
python3 run.py -c example_configurations/simplest_example_1.ini -o output_example
```
This will extract the experiment configuration from the `simplest_example_1.ini` file and write any output file into the `output_example` folder.
If the `-o` argument is missing, the default name `output` will be used for the output folder.
Please note that if the output folder already exists, it will not be overwritten, and the execution will stop right away.

Results will be summarized in the `results.txt` file, as well as printed to screen during the execution of the experiment.


### Predicting module
This library also has a predicting module, in which you can use an output model in the form of a Pickle file to make predictions about new, previously-unseen data.
It is run via the [`predict.py`](predict.py) file.
First of all, run the library to create a regression model (similarly to the first part of the section):
```shell
python3 run.py -c example_configurations/faas_test.ini -o output_test
```
Then, you can apply the obtained model in the form of the `LRRidge.pickle` file by running:
```shell
python3 predict.py -c example_configurations/faas_predict.ini -r output_test/LRRidge.pickle -o output_test_predict
```
For more information, please refer to the [`predict.py`](predict.py) file itself and to the [README.md](example_configurations/README.md#prediction-files) for configuration files.


## Docker image
This section shows how to create and use the Docker container image for this library.
It is not strictly needed, but it ensures an environment in which dependencies have the correct version, and in which it is guaranteed that the library works correctly.
This Docker image can be built from the `Dockerfile` at the root folder of this repository by using:
```shell
docker build -t amllibrary .
```
(You might need to add `sudo` if Docker requires root permissions on your machine.)
To run a container and mount a volume which includes the root folder of this repository, please use:
```shell
docker run --name aml --rm -v $(pwd):/aMLLibrary -it amllibrary
```
which defaults to a `bash` terminal unless a specific command is appended to the line.
In this terminal, you may run the same commands as in a regular terminal, including the ones from the [Tutorial](#tutorial) section.


## Hyperopt
This library is integrated with the Hyperopt package for hyperparameter tuning via Bayesian Optimization.
For more information, please refer to the [`README.md`](example_configurations/README.md#hyperopt) for configuration files.
