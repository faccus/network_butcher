- chrono.h: It implements a simple "timer" class that measures how long a specific portion of code takes to run
- Factory.h: It contains a generic factory class, used to implement KFinder_Factory
- GetPot: It contains GetPot, a header only library that it's used by Network Butcher to read a configuration file
