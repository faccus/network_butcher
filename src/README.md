## Contents

This directory contains the source files of the program. The main directories are:

- APSC: This directory contains the source files of libraries taken from the APSC repository
- Computer (WIP): It contains the source files required to compute the FLOPS and MACS for the given network
- IO_Interaction: It contains the source files used to interact with the onnx files and the yaml files
- K-shortest_path: It contains the source file for the K-shortest path algorithm
- Onnx_model: It contains the header and source file of an onnx model. It was automatically generated by compiling through the protobuf compiler (protoc) the [.proto3 schema file](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/onnx/onnx.proto3).
- Types: It contains the source files for the custom types

This directory also contains:
- main.cpp: the main file of the network_butcher application
- Utilities.cpp: the source file of the Utility functions
- IO_Manager.cpp: the Input/Output manager of the program. All the IO interactions that the program performs happen here
- General_Manager.cpp: it contains the basic pipeline followed by the program to butcher a network
