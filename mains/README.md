## mains Directory Contents
This directory contains some main files that a user can utilize to either execute the "butchering" directly by command 
line or to perform some performance tests.
The contained files are:
- main.cpp: It will read from the input of the program the location of a GetPot configuration file and execute the 
function 'boot' of General_Manager (thus, if the file exists, the parameters will be imported and the actual butchering 
will start based on the provided parameters).
- Butcher/main_Constrained_Builder.cpp: This 'test' main file will make the library construct a simple 'linear' graph 
(each node, with the exception of the input and output nodes, will have exactly one input and one output) with a varying
number of nodes (powers of two, starting from 2^10 up to 2^22. The upper limit can be overridden by adding as a program
input 'max_power') and it will construct its associated block graph.
- IO_Manager/main_IO_Manager.cpp: This 'test' main file will try to measure how long the library takes to export a 
partitioning from a given collection of models.
The number of exported paths will vary (power of two, from 2^5 to 2^11. The upper limit can be overridden by adding as
a program input 'max_k_power'. If the model cannot provide the requested number of partitionings, it will proceed with 
the test for the next model)
- KFinder/main_kfinder.cpp: This 'test' main file will just measure how long both Eppstein and Lazy Eppstein algorithm 
take to find the K shortest path distances from a given collection of sample graphs, generated by 
[library checker problems](https://github.com/yosupo06/library-checker-problems).
- KFinder/main_path_reconstruction.cpp: This 'test' main file will just measure how long both Eppstein and Lazy Eppstein 
  algorithm take to find the K shortest paths from a given collection of sample graphs, generated by
  [library checker problems](https://github.com/yosupo06/library-checker-problems).
- KFinder/main_synthetic_graph.cpp: This 'test' main file will measure how long does the Eppstein and Lazy Eppstein
algorithm take to find the shortest path on a block graph, with a varying number of 'linear' nodes and requested paths
(the number of devices was fixed to three)
