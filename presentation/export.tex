\begin{frame}{Model reconstruction and export}
    Once the K shortest path method is applied to the "block" graph, the following steps must be performed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Construction of the associated path in the original graph, taking into account the device onto which every node must be runned. 
    \item Generate the different onnx::ModelProto associated to the different sub-graphs of the original graph. Every onnx::ModelProto is associated to a specific device
    \item Finally, the different onnx::ModelProto are exported in the .onnx file in the specified directory
\end{enumerate}
